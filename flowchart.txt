ABNet Adaptive Balanced Network for Multiscale Object Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Satellite Object Image Detection Data
3. Installing the packages required for yolov5 in Colab
4. Processing the Data based on yolov5 model
	- counting number of images
	- reading images
	- reading xmls files
	- creating bb array
	- creating the mask
	- resizing the image
5. Image Data Augmentation for FasterRCNN
	- cropping the image
	- rotate the image
	- transforming the image to array
6. Building the model in colab
	- YOLOV5
	- Faster-RCNN
7. Training the model
8. Building the model with YOLOv5
9. Importing the packages
10. Exploring the dataset - Satellite Object Image
11. Processing the IMage using Keras
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image
12. Extracting and SPlitting the data train and test set
13. Building the model
	- AlexNet Backbone of RICNN
	- ZFNet Backbone of RICADO
	- ResNet Backbone of ABNet
	- ResNet101 Backbone of other model
	- VGG16
14. Training the model
Flask Framework
================
15. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
16. User gives input as Image
17. The given input preprocessed and with trained model is used for detection 
18. The segmented each object and put bounding box 
19. Final outcome is displayed
